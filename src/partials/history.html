        <p class="history__desc">The history of Bose Corporation began 
            with disappointment. In 1956, MIT graduate student Amar Bose bought one of the best stereo systems at the time for his home.
            After a few minutes of listening to the audio recording, his bewilderment turned 
            to disappointment.</p>

            <p class="history__desc">From Amar's point of view, the sound was 
                so flat and unnatural that it was better not 
                to listen to the music at all than to listen 
                to it in such a distorted form.</p>
            <p class="history__desc">Bose's frustration grew into a firm determination to build audio equipments that would reproduce sound with impeccable accuracy and naturalness</p>
